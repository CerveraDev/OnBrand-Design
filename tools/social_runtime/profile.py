"""Project profile: the facts about a project that an admin records once.

`projects/<project>/profile.json` holds the official name, nickname, contact
details, addresses, and social account settings. It is medium-neutral, so any runtime may
read it; here it supplies the simulator's account handle and picture. Fields an
admin has not filled in are null, and fields this module does not know are kept.
